		<p>Twitch chat has been called "cancerous", a "cess pool", etc. etc. However, within the chaos that is the constant spamming and shitposting of Twitch chat, there will occasionally be an absolutely hilarious/ridiculous comment. You would read it, laugh at it, and then it would be forever gone. <span style="color: #866bb9">TwitchQuotes</span> is a way to preserve these comments. You can add, save, and browse some of the best comments that have ever come out of Twitch chat.
